# Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-Classification

This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is written in python language. This CNN model is trained on few thousand images of cats and dogs, and later be able to predict if the given image is of a cat or a dog. This model achieves over 80% accuracy.

The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps. </br>
Step 1: Convolution 
Step 2: Pooling 
Step 3: Flattening 
Step 4: Full connection 0
